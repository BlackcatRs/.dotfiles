=CPUWeight= defaults to 100 for all processes on the system. Setting a low value still lets process use the CPU if nothing else is effectively keeping the system responsive for other tasks while not slowing down the results much. This is a arbitrary weight integer.

=CPUQuota= is an absolute limit on how much CPU time is granted even if nothing else is going on. This is a percent value.

=IOWeight= is much the same as CPUWeight, in this case used to keep disks free for system tasks. Allowing the process to use the disk when nothing else continues to use the disk without slowing down the result too much.

=MemorySwapMax= is set to 0 Gigs to use only RAM and not SWAP memory.
