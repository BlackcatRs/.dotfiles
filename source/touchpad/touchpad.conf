# This is a configuration file for the touchpad used to modify its
# behavior and how it responds to touches. Here, I have activated
# touch as a click and changed the direction of mouse scrolling.
# Do not manually edit this file; it is generated by the
# .dotfiles/source/touchpad/README.org  Org file.
# In order to use this conf create a symlink in
# /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-touchpad.conf to this file
