* Syncthing Directory/File Permission Setup
The service =syncthing-perm= is used to set the ownership and permission of =/home/syncthing/= directory in order to allow syncthing to sync files.

=CPUWeight= defaults to 100 for all processes on the system. Setting a low value still lets process use the CPU if nothing else is effectively keeping the system responsive for other tasks while not slowing down the results much. This is a arbitrary weight integer.

=CPUQuota= is an absolute limit on how much CPU time is granted even if nothing else is going on. This is a percent value. In my case it wasn't really necessary to set this to fix the resource hogging issue. I ended up setting it anyway to keep the CPU temperature down when lots of CI jobs pile up.

=IOWeight= is much the same as CPUWeight, in this case used to keep disks free for system tasks and only keep them busy with CI jobs when nothing else is going on.

=MemorySwapMax= is set to 0 Gigs to use only RAM and not SWAP memory.
