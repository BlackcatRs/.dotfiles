# How and what to sync local and remote mailbox
###################################
# Exclude everything under the internal [Gmail] folder, except the
# interesting folders
# Patterns * ![Gmail]* "[Gmail]/Sent Mail" "[Gmail]/Starred" "[Gmail]/All Mail"
# Or include everything
Patterns *
# Automatically create missing mailboxes, both locally and on the
# server For ex: if create a folder on the server or local, the next
# time mbsync run it won't create the folder
Create Both
# Sync the movement of messages between folders and deletions, add
# after making sure the sync works
Expunge Both
# Save the synchronization state files in the relevant directory (in
# local mailbox folder) For an example if we move all of downloaded
# mails and the next time we run mbsync, it will read default sync
# state file and assume that we delete all mails and make that change
# to remote repo.
